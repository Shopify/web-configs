## Unreleased

### Breaking Change

- Update desktop Safari / iOS Safari minimum supported versions. This brings iOS Safari support inline with the recent updates to Shopify mobile app's minimum supported versions, which now require a minimum version of iOS 13.6. iOS Safari targets `ios >= 13.4` which matches the caniuse target of `ios_saf 13.4-13.7`. Desktop Safari targets `last 3 safari versions` to match other desktop browser support, which matches the caniuse target of `safari 13.1`. [#274](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/274)
