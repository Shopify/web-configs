## 20.1.0 - 2019-09-24

- Pass `browsers` web preset config string directly into babel-preset-env's targets option, so that if it is unset we shall read honor browserslist config in package.json / .browserslistrc

## 20.0.0 - 2019-06-03

- Add `babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node` to the node preset. This was originally added in 19.1.0 then reverted in 19.1.1 as it was a breaking change in some circumstances

## 19.1.1 - 2019-06-03

- Revert Adding `babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node` to the node preset as this may be a breaking change in some circumstances

## 19.1.0 - 2019-05-29

- Added `typescript` option to node and web presets to allow babel to read typescript files when set to true.
- Added `babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node` to the node preset
- Removed `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-catch-binding` because it is already handled by `@babel/preset-env` if you specify an environment where it is needed.

## 19.0.1 - 2019-05-23

- Added `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-catch-binding` to `node` and `web` presets

## 19.0.0 - 2019-05-06

- Switched the default `useBuiltIns` option back to `entry`, since it has a smaller bundle impact on large applications

## 18.1.0 - 2019-04-22

## 18.0.0 - 2019-03-19

### Changed

## 17.0.0 - 2019-01-03

### Changed

- All presets now only work with Babel version 7 or greater.
- `browsers` are no longer hardcoded to those supported by Shopifyâ€™s admin for the purposes of the `shopify/web` preset. You must provide a [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)-compatible configuration within your project, which will be used automatically when running Babel with this preset. Projects can use [`@shopify/browserslist-config`](https://github.com/Shopify/browserslist-config) to get the same support as Shopifyâ€™s admin.
- The `shopify/web` preset no longer includes plugins for Stage 3 features. The only non-standard features included in this preset are class properties and dynamic imports.


### Removed

- Removed `shopify/flow` preset since it is no longer used by most projects at Shopify.

### Updated

## 15.0.1
