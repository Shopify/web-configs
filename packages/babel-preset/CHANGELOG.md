# Changelog

## 25.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#347](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/347) [`7fbbceb`](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/commit/7fbbceb15334f8ebeefda43c18f72a149c20ec41) Thanks [@developit](https://github.com/developit)! - Allow customizing Babel assumptions, and adopt some reasonably loose defaults rather than the normal strict defaults. This shall result in smaller transpiled files, at the expense of not following specs exactly when encountering edge cases.

## 19.0.1 - 2019-05-23

- Added `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-catch-binding` to `node` and `web` presets

## 19.0.0 - 2019-05-06

- `browsers` are no longer hardcoded to those supported by Shopifyâ€™s admin for the purposes of the `shopify/web` preset. You must provide a [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)-compatible configuration within your project, which will be used automatically when running Babel with this preset. Projects can use [`@shopify/browserslist-config`](https://github.com/Shopify/browserslist-config) to get the same support as Shopifyâ€™s admin.
- The `shopify/web` preset no longer includes plugins for Stage 3 features. The only non-standard features included in this preset are class properties and dynamic imports.

### Changed

- `shopify/web` and `shopify/node` presets now use [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) to transpile only the features needed for the target environment.

## 15.0.1
