## [19.0.1] - 2019-05-23

- Added `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-catch-binding` to `node` and `web` presets

## [19.0.0] - 2019-05-06

## [18.1.0] - 2019-04-22

## [17.0.0] - 2019-01-03

### Changed

- All presets now only work with Babel version 7 or greater.
- `browsers` are no longer hardcoded to those supported by Shopifyâ€™s admin for the purposes of the `shopify/web` preset. You must provide a [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)-compatible configuration within your project, which will be used automatically when running Babel with this preset. Projects can use [`@shopify/browserslist-config`](https://github.com/Shopify/browserslist-config) to get the same support as Shopifyâ€™s admin.
- The `shopify/web` preset no longer includes plugins for Stage 3 features. The only non-standard features included in this preset are class properties and dynamic imports.

### Removed

- `shopify/web` now accepts an additional option, `browsers` (an array of [`browserslist`](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) strings) which specifies what browsers to transpile for (defaults to the browsers supported by Shopifyâ€™s admin).


### Changed

- `shopify/web` and `shopify/node` presets now use [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) to transpile only the features needed for the target environment.
- Updated all versions of dependend-on plugins and presets.

## [15.0.1]
