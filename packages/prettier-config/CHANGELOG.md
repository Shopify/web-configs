# Changelog

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#468](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/468) [`21bf8bb`](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/commit/21bf8bbb86d819df07893fbcd66eb1b8575eabe7) Thanks [@znja](https://github.com/znja)! - NPM provenance statements

## 1.1.0 - 2020-05-14

### Changed

- Explicitly set default for `"arrowParens": "always"`. Although it is a default for prettier as of v2.0, it was `avoid` in prior versions. Specifying it explicitly here will result in the same config, not matter which version of prettier used.

## 1.0.0 - 2020-05-12

### Added

- Created `@shopify/prettier-config` package. [[#152](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/152)]
