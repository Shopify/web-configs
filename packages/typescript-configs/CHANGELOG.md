<!-- ## Unreleased -->

## 5.1.0 - 2021-11-18

### Added

- Added `node-base` and `node-library` configs for projects that don't need DOM typings. [[#290](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/290)]

## 5.0.0 - 2021-06-11

### Breaking Change

Increased the target and lib definitions to es2020 in both `base.json` and `dom.json`. This allows for a greater range of standard features to be defined and used. We expect typescript will be ran through Babel to downlevel/polyfill all features required for your target environment. [[#239](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/239)]

## 4.0.0 - 2021-02-24

### Breaking Change

Set `isolatedModules` to be true by default. Sewing-kit is moving away from a `tsc` based compilation process, towards using babel/esbuild only single file transpilation. Prepare consumers for this change by making type-checking identify code that can be problematic with single-file transpilers. [[#214](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/214)]

## 3.0.0 - 2020-06-04

### Breaking Change

The Shopify typescript definition for `.scss` and `.css` have changed.

Before: 

```
import * as styles from 'foo.scss';
```

After: 

```
import styles from 'foo.scss';
```

- Updated the `*.scss` and `*.css` types for esmodules. [[#165](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/165)]

## 2.0.2 - 2020-03-28

- Start of Changelog
- Move the package from [`sewing-kit`](https://github.com/Shopify/sewing-kit).
