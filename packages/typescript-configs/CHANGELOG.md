<!-- ## Unreleased -->

## 4.0.0 - 2021-02-24

### Breaking Change

Set `isolatedModules` to be true by default. Sewing-kit is moving away from a `tsc` based compilation process, towards using babel/esbuild only single file transpilation. Prepare consumers for this change by making type-checking identify code that can be problematic with single-file transpilers. [[#214](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/pull/214)]
